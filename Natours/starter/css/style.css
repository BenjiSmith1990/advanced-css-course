Some advice for students watching in 2019 and beyond:



-- Once, you get to lecture #33 (section 5), skip ahead to the Trillo Project (section 7) where you learn about building a UI with a flexbox-based grid.

-- Stop once you reach the media query lectures for that project.

-- Come back here. Watch how the Natours project is done in a float layout and understand how it works BUT instead use flexbox grid to build your version of Natours. Learn media queries at that point as well.

-- Return to Trillo to add in the media queries.



It's good to know about float-based layouts, because you may see them in legacy code. But it's not a great idea to start building things in that system today. */
